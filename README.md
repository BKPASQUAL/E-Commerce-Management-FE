## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Steps to Set Up the Project

#### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone <https://github.com/BKPASQUAL/E-Commerce-Management-FE.git>
```

#### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Move into the project directory using:
```bash
cd <project-folder>
```
Replace `<project-folder>` with the name of the folder containing the project files.

#### 3. Install Dependencies
Install all the required packages by running:
```bash
npm install
```
This will install all the dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.

#### 4. Run the Project Locally
Start the development server with the following command:
```bash
npm run dev
```

#### 5. Access the Hosted Application
The application is hosted online for public access. Use the following link to visit it:
[**Hosted Application**](https://e-commerce-management-fe.vercel.app)

Replace `e-commerce-management-fe.vercel.app` with the actual hosted link (e.g., `e-commerce-management-fe.vercel.app`).

#### 6. Access the Local Application
If running locally, check the terminal for the URL or port where the server is running (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

### Additional Commands

- **Run in Development Mode**:  
  If the project supports development mode with live reloading, use:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
  Check the documentation or `package.json` scripts to confirm.

- **Run Tests**:  
  If the project has tests, run them using:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during setup, ensure that:

- All prerequisites are installed correctly.
- The repository URL is correct.
- The terminal/command prompt has the necessary permissions.

Feel free to contact the repository maintainer if the issue persists.
